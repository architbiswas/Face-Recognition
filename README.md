# Face-Recognition
The main objective of the project was to track faces through real-time video feed from a drone for detecting criminals or a person faces from the database.
The drone can fly and detect faces and send alert to the operator regarding it. This project was a prototype and face detection was limited to very close range. Improvements have to be done. 
This project has been made by using Python and OpenCV
